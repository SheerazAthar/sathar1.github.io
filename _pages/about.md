Welcome! My name is Sheeraz, and I am a Research Engineer at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Robotics Institue. I work at the intersection of Robotics, Biomechanics & Materials and develop robots categorized as soft, origami, and bio-inspired. As robots are more integrated with humans than ever before, we are in great need to make sure that this engagement is mutually beneficial and innocuous. Soft material robots are the most promising solution to achieve this goal. Soft Robots are made up of flexible and deformable materials which can use their natural compliance to respond to unknown environments, making them both adaptable and safe to work along.
