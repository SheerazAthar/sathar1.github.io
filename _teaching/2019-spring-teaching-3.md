This project presents a robot design that is inspired from Origami and Auxetic materials. The strcuture can be used as a Quadruped and a Gripper.



Description
======
In this project, I designed novel actuators for soft robots. The growth of soft robotics is highly dependent on the availability of the soft actuators to move them. Working in this link I have developed a Origami inspired rotary actuator. This actuator is vacuum driven and rotates in a curvature when vacuumed. In addition to this, I am also utilised auxetic structure principles to construct switching structures for robotic components. Combining these two phenomenon I have constructed a robotic component that can work both as a gripper and a crawling robot. Initial findings of this have been accepted for publication in IROS 2020. Figure below shows details of the project.
