This project presents bi-directional actuators that can linear motion in two mutually perpendicular directions. This kind of motion in unique and be used for various functionalities.

Description
===========

Traditionally actuators used in robotics are mostly single input and single output. Contrary to this, I here in this project tried to construct a bi-directional actuator. The developed actuator can provide linear motion in two perpendicular directions approximately. I have done analysis in order to program the actuators according to the requirement. In addition characterization of actuator force, speed, material and successive actuation is done. Fabrication of the actuator through various 3D printing technologies is also discussed. Different element of the study are presented in the below figure.
