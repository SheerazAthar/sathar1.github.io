This project was done as a part of UG thesis. I developed a finger rehabiliatation device in this project that was controlled through brian EEG signals.



Description
======
Unfortunate happenings like accident, stroke etc. often render the affected person motion less or with restricted motion. Rehabilitation methods can be used to mitigate this situation. To facilitate this, we developed a exoskeleton which is Electroencephalography (EEG) based. Use of EEG signals allows the user to control the device with his/her brain. With this functionality those patients that can’t move their limbs due a traumatic event can themselves do rehabilitation exercise. We developed a linkage structure exoskeleton driven by a linear actuator. For controlling, EEG signals were recorded and relevant features were extracted and classified into imaginary and executed tasks. Figure below shows the description of Exoskeleton’s working.
