This was an independent project that completed in Prof. Khan's lab as a UG student. It was a joint colloboration between All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and Aligarh Muslim University (AMU).

Description
======
In this independent project I worked alongside dentists to analyse the physical effects on mandible caused due to implants through finite element analysis. Simulations were carried out to predict the effects of various implants on human mandible. We designed rough estimates of the implants and assembled them on the mandible CAD file. Forces that implant applies were simulated and stress generated was recorded. Our study shows that the proposed implants cause little or no stress on the mandible. Following is the visual description of the project.
