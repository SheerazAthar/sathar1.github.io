One of the factor that restricts the performance of soft robotic components is their low working life and meagre structural strength. To circumvent this limitation, I am trying to develop methods for fibre reinforced 3D printing. With this technology, soft parts with better structural strength will be developed ushering a new class of soft robots. Project is in prototyping stage and the results, so far, are very promising.
