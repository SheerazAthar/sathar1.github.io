Abstract: The basis of this study is to provide an idea about finite element analysis
(FEA) applied to orthodontic treatments. This paper employs FEA to investigate
the stresses developed on tooth enamel and adjoining tissues when subjected to
a certain load. The analysis is done by computer-aided engineering (CAE)-based
software Autodesk InventorÂ©. For simulation, 3-D models of teeth were created in
the shape of truncated pyramids. These modeled teeth were then assembled with the
CAD model of human mandible. After the analysis, the software generated a report
depicting graphical distribution of stress, strain, and safety factor over the assembly of
mandible. In our study, all the physical parameters fall under safe limit, hence causing
no damage/injuries if clinically demonstrated. Any other loading condition can easily
be analyzed by feeding the required data. Novelty of the proposed approach is in the
approximate 3D modeling of teeth based on the knowledge of its dimension, without
taking the actual model into consideration. This methodology can be extended to a
wider range as this is cost effective and simple.
