Abstract: Functional restoration of arm and hand movements is a challenging goal
of post-stroke/trauma rehabilitation therapy. The post-stroke/trauma conditions often
may lead to partial or total loss of motor function. Therefore, the use of assistive
brain-controlled robotic exoskeleton has recently gained a lot of interest from the
bioengineering research community. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG)
has been used for controlling the exoskeleton and for providing the brain–machine
interface (BMI) roadmap. The brain signalswere recorded corresponding to different
imagined movement by normal subjects using 10–20 standard electrode placement
system. A sample of the EEG recorded at a frequency of at least 160 Hz was preprocessed
to remove the line frequency interference and artifacts. Features were then
extracted from the EEG signal and processed to actuate the exoskeleton, thus ultimately
assisting the subject in his/her rehabilitation program. A linear discriminant
analysis (LDA)-based classifier is used to map the extracted features to a specific
task. This study has achieved the best accuracy of 97.101% using linear classifiers
and 72.133% using quadratic classifiers. This paper presents system design and
development along with an experimental evaluation of EEG-driven exoskeleton. This
exoskeleton could then be used to assist in the rehabilitation program of stroke/trauma
patients.
